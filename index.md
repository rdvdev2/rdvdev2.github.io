## Hello, I'm rdvdev2
I'm an amateur developer and a last year High School student in Sant Andreu, Barcelona. I'm the creator of the **Time Travel Mod** for Minecraft.

### My projects
 - **Time Travel Mod:** A mod for Minecraft that allows to build Time Machines and travel in the time. Check out the project on [CurseFroge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/time-travel-mod) and the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/rdvdev2/TimeTravelMod).
 - **Disable Custom Worlds Advice:** A simple mod for Minecraft that disables those annoying "Experimental Settings" warnings that you may or may not care about. Check it out on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-disable-custom-worlds-advice) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/rdvdev2/DisableCustomWorldsAdvice).
 - **LoL Tournament Engine:** After using *Toornament* for a couple of tournaments with my classmates, I decided to adventure on the world of Spring Boot and I'm currently developing a platform for League Of Legends tournament organization. It's still a WIP, so no source code by the moment. :(

### Investigation
 - **Cybersecurity: How are software vulnerabilities found and exploited?** This document is my still WIP High School invesitgation project. When finished, I will post it here in Catalan and translate it to English later when I find time for it.
